# blackjack
Play my modified version Blackjack on your terminal by running the command: "python blackjack.py".

You can hit, wait, or bet against the dealer to see who is closest to 21 without going over!

This algorithm uses a list to keep track of player and dealer hands, as well as a list for the overall deck. I used random to get cards from the deck.

Thank you and enjoy my game :).
